# Day 11/365 - Slide
By TLS / Teleese

## Description
Slide is a script for Haxball rooms that gives players a "super kick" with cooldown and animated avatar. When a player holds the kick for more than 1.5 seconds, they get a speed boost in their current direction, with a smooth slowdown effect. The action has a 23-second cooldown to prevent spamming, and the player's avatar temporarily changes to ðŸ‘Ÿ during the boost.

## Features
- Detects kicks automatically
- Speed boost in the player's current direction
- Smooth progressive slowdown
- 23-second cooldown per player
- Temporary avatar change during the boost
- Works with multiple players

## How to Use
1. Copy and paste the script into your Haxball room script.
2. Initialize each player using the `initPlayer(player)` function when they join.
3. Players can now enjoy the Slide effect in your room.
